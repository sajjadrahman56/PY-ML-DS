Before cloud computing, they built a data center that consisted of Hardware , Memory, Ram and a lot of other staff . 

What is cloud computing ?

Cloud is just a computing metaphor for the internet , when we say cloud we are just referring to the internet. Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services over the internet , enabling faster innovation,flexible resources , and economy of scale .

Computing services ( install os , ram , different types of functionality ) alternatively we can say that this refers all of the things individually we can perform in our local computer 

In the simplest term , cloud computing means storing and accessing data and programs over the internet instead of our local computer’s hard drive 

 Cloud Service providers Offer:
Providers are Azure , AWS 

Compute power : such as windows and linux virtual machine 
Storage : such as object storage 
Applications: such as NoSql or Sql database applications 
Networking : such as setting up virtual networks for your VM 
Analytics : such as visualizing telemetry and performance data 

Deployment Models in the Cloud Computing 

Basically it means how we make users in the cloud . 

Private Cloud 

Organizations create a cloud environment in their datacenter 
Organizations is responsible for operating the services they provide 
Does not access users outside of the Organization.
Public Cloud
	
	 
Owned by cloud services or hosting provider
Providers resources and services to the multiple organizations and users 
Accessed via secure network connections 





The basic difference is like the example that is you have a car that only you can drive , on the other hand a public transport that is use by all of the society people




In the world 2 things happen all time it is either Sell or Services 

** In the cloud everything under comes to the service it can be Infrastructure or software or resources . All are under the service categories . 

** The service provider shares the infrastructure with multiple organizations , where they care about the security . Isolation can separate organization to organization .

Hybrid Cloud

Combines Public and Private cloud to allow applications to run in the most appropriate location .


The key Difference between Public, Private and Hybrid Cloud 


public
private
hybrid 
No capital expenditures to scale up

Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned 

Organizations pay only for what they use 
Hardware must be purchased for start up and maintenance 

Organizations have complete control over resources and security 

Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates

Complete privacy control in here 
Provides the most flexibility 

Organizations determine where to run their applications 

Organizations control security , compliance or legal requirements

** In the exam there i question must come from to the Public Private and hybrid  model 



Cloud Benefits 

Compare to capEx and OpEx

Here capEx = capital expenditure 
	
	The up-front spending of money on physical infrastructure 
	
	Cost from capEx have a value that reduce over the time 

For example i need a car , that I use daily which save my boring times 

Most of the time I buy resources . 

Operational Expenditure ( OpEx )

Spend on products and services as needed , pay as you go 
Get billed immediately 


Here is an example that can clear the idea of us OpEx and CapEx 

Ac in our room is CapEx and the eclectic bill come how much we use the AC in our room 
So here electricity is OpEx


The 100% use is OpEx cause you use or buy as much as our need 

If we are in the phase of start up we invest more in the OpEx rather than the CapEx  as we do not know how long we will stay 

 
The thing keep in your mind that is Public cloud is CapEx and the private is OpEx 


Consumption Based Model 

 Cloud service providers operate on a consumption-based model which means that end uses only pay for the resources that they use . Whatever they use is what they pay for .

Best cost Prediction 
Prices for individual resources and services are provided 
Billing is based on actual age 

Overall, I start a resource use called VM at a certain period I realize that this is no longer needed for my cloud center. What if I buy it for $19999 but I can use 
Cloud Benefits / Features 

High availability 		Reliability 
Security			Manageability
Scalability			Predictability 
Governance 

High availability: This Means our website or app deploys on multiple devices as it is not the problem that arises if my site is deployed in one machine one day the machine fails , you will see a black screen. I will lose everything . In the cloud they give me the chance to deploy multiple data centers to store our site  

The data center is different based on the geographic region and so on . If one fails I can find it easily from the other data center . 

Reliability  :   If we save one file in the Microsoft data center it stores three copies of the same file in the 3 different disks . Automatically data  find 

Scalability :  Certain increase the traffic , our existence the infrastructure is not capable of that so what happens it is going to crash . Means I have a blog site where daily users 1M one day it goes to 10M then my site crashes . 

The solution is increasing computing power or more servers to load .

The best outcome is Scalability means the site infrastructure or size or load depends on the user request . If users rise the size or capability increases on the other hand decreases the capacity  . 

Scalability two types : Horizontal and vertical 

Vertical scaling is focused on increasing or decreasing the capabilities of resources. Horizontal scaling is adding or subtracting the number of resources

In every cloud center Scalability is one of the most Important things .

Predictability :  Predict the situation . How much the cost is or uses of resources . For example I purchase 10 VM if I run the full month how much the cost is . 
Predictability we should use ahead of time .

Security : Cloud provides multiple security as hackers or no one can easily access the file . Moreover the security is much much secure than our own data center 

Governance : Every organizations has some set of rules for use of resources , low of implementations 

Cloud Computing Service model 
There are 3 service models . Again remember in this world everything is a product or services 

Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS)
Platform as a Service ( PaaS)
Software as a Service ( SaaS ) 
Identify appropriate use case for each cloud service ( IaaS , PaaS and SaaS )



Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS)
Delivers compute infrastructure, typically a platform visualization environment as a service.
Cloud providers build data centers, managing power, scale , hardware, networking , storage, distributed system, etc 
Rather than purchasing servers, software, data center, space, or network equipment, clients instead buy those resources as a fully outsourced service. 


Example: AWS EC2, Azure VM, and GCP Compute Engine 


Platform as a Service ( PaaS)
Providers environment for building, testing , and deploying software applications; without focusing on managing the underlying infrastructure 

Its an offering that provides platform for developing running and managing applications worrying about infrastructure provisioning and maintenance 
Cloud providers offer an Internet-based platform to developers who create services.


Examples : 
AWS Elastic Beanstalk 
Azure App Service
Google App Engine


 
Software as a service 

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       

 a)
SaaS is a software delivery methodology that provides licensed multi-teant access to software and its function remotely as a web-based service 
b) From the end user’s point of view apps are located in the cloud and it is almost alwasys accessible through a web browser 
Any application hosted on a remote server that can be accessed over the internet is considered as SaaS 
Usually billed based on usage and a multi-tenant environment 

 








IaaS PaaS and SaaS 

IaaS
PaaS
SaaS
. Most flexible cloud service 

You configure and manage the hardware for your application 
Focus on application Development 

Platform management is handled by the cloud provider 
Pay as you go pricing model 

Users pay for the software they use on a subscription model 





Disadvantages of Public cloud 

Decent Internet Connectivity is mandatory
Can be costly if resources are no managed properly
Restricted or limited control of Infrastructure 
Risk of vendor lock in 
Data security and privacy concerns 
( most important things ) 








Azure Architectural  component 

	Regions
	
 Regions are made up of one or more data centers in the close proximity 
Provide flexibility and scale to reduce customer latency 
     Preserve data residency with a comprehensive compliance offering 


One regions has 3 zones 

More regions need consumer request calls . It made to reduce the latency of the customer 

If it is not built what happens the problem might be Request time is long and consumer feel boring and deprive from the services 



Availability zones

Provide protection against downtime due to datacenter failure 
Physically separate data centers within the same region 
Ecah datacenter is equipped with independent power cooling and networking . If one is down other zones are available . Physically separated but strong;y connected 


Connected through private fiber-optic networks 

Means one file save automatically in three zones .  !

Means one file save automatically in three zones .  !;35 minutes 




Avoid downtime ( lost the data center ) split the datacenter in different place within the same region . 

Region Pairs 

.At least 300 miles of separation between region pairs 
Automatic replication for same services 
Prioritized region recovery in the event of outage 
Updates are rollout sequentially to minimize downtime 

So why pairs in need ? 
Ok , at first 3 files are saved in the region and 3 other files in the 2nd region . Do this for high availability . If the entire region is Down , there is hope to find the resources from to the second location means pairs location . 



Data center are available in Availability Zones , Availability Zones are available  in the the Region 
And Regions are available in the Geographics 

Azure resources 

Everything in the cloud is services .

Azure resources are components like storage , virtual machines , and networks that are available to build cloud solutions 

Virtual networks connected to the resources ( virtual machine ) are also resources .








Resources Group 

A resources group is a container to manage and aggregate resources in a single unit .

Resources can exist in different regions 
Resources can exist in only one group 
Resources can be moved to different resources groups 
Applications can utilize multiple resource groups 


Different resources group means that when I create a VM I select the region that is in central India . Ok fine now I  want to create storage resources , I select the region is Germany . Is it possible in two different places, yes . It is possible . 

Resources group is Logical Datacenter not physical 

For exam : resources and resource group   not necessary must be in the same region they can be different region 

Azure Subscription 

Subscription is billing boundary 

An azure subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure accounts 

Billing Boundary : Generate separate billing reports and invoices for each subscription 
Access Control Boundary: Manage and control access to the resources that users can provision with specific subscriptions 


Management Group

Management groups can include multiple azure subscriptions 
Subscriptions inherit conditions applied to the management group 
10,000 management groups can be supported in a single directory
A management group tree can support up to six levels of depth .


Management groups can be nested means A management group inside has another management group , it can manage another group otherwise subscription can not be inside subscription   . a resource group like a subscription group . Remember one thing that Resources group are INDEPENDENT 



These are very important things that we must remember . 


Define Container Services 

Containers are a virtualization environment where you do not manage an operating system . 

Azure Container Instance

A PaAs offering that allows you to upload your containers which it then will run for you .

Azure Kubernetes Service 

A container Orchestrator service for managing large numbers of containers 



 

Define Azure data categories 




Schema
Data relationship 
Examples 
Structured data
Adheres to a schema with the same data fields or properties 
Storable in relationship database tables with rows and columns 
Sensor data and financial data 
Semi-Structured data 
Has an ad hoc schema with less organized fields and properties  
Non-relational or NoSql data , not storable in tables rows and column 
Books , blogs , JSON , XML , HTML , documents 
Unstructured data
Has no designated schema or data structure 
No-relational or blob data , with no restrictions on the kinds of data blobs contain 
PDFs,JPGs,videos 



Explore Azure Database Services 

Azure cosmos DB

Azure cosmos DB is globally distributed database service 

Its public and high availability means my data center is local , I can get the same replica in the US data center .

If do anything update in the local within few seconds it updates globally too . 

For example if i sell products in the local one , if i did not update soon other customer would order the same products . 

Azure Sql database 
It is a relational database as a service ( DaaS ) 

Azure Database Migration
It is a fully-managed service designed to enable seamless migrations from multiple database sources to Azure data platforms with minimal downtime .




Define Serverless Computing 

That does not mean this application do not need server  , any memory any cpu 

It means on demand the program is going to require assign memory and processor .
